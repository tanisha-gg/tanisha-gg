## Hi there 👋

⭐ I'm a Physics PhD student with a strong background in computational modelling, data analysis, and high-performance computing. I am currently working on problems in plasma physics, specifically performing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations to gain insights into the behaviour of astrophysical phenomena. 

🪐 My GitHub profile includes some projects I've worked on - mostly to do with solving Physics equations, as well as data analysis and machine learning pipelines for Physics applications.
