## Hi there 👋

⭐ I'm a Physics PhD student with a strong background in computational modelling, data analysis, and high-performance computing. I am currently working on problems in plasma physics, specifically performing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations to gain insights into the behaviour of astrophysical phenomena. 

My repository includes some projects I've worked on - mostly data analysis and machine learning for Physics applications.
